				Welcome to Doggos Doing Good! Did you know that dogs can provide important health benefits? Being around animals makes people feel better, healthier, and happier. Pet therapy is a growing field that uses dogs and other pets to help children and adults recover from, or cope with, a range of health problems, such as heart disease, cancer and mental health disorders. Animal-assisted activities, on the other hand, have a more general purpose, such as providing comfort and enjoyment for nursing home residents.
